// WORKAROUND https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/18810
//
// This file is required to run ngc on 3rd party libraries such as @ngrx,
// to write files like node_modules/@ngrx/store/store.ngsummary.json.
//
// Using ngc to create generated files is sufficient as long
// as there are no components or directives in the 3rd party library
// that are used. If there are, then there is an existing issue where
// components & modules that use these 3rd party components or directives
// can't be tested with ts_web_test_suite().
// See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/issues/192
//
// The work-around for this right now is to compile the 3rd party
// from source using Bazel so that Bazel is used to create
// its generated files.
